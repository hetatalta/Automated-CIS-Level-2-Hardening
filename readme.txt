Python Script for Automated CIS Level 2 Hardening
This script automatically checks the operating system, downloads the corresponding CIS benchmark, and applies Level 2 hardening.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
requests library
win32com.client library (for Windows)
os library
Disclaimer:

This script is for educational purposes only. Be cautious while running it on your machine. Ensure you understand the impact of each setting before applying. Improper configuration may affect your system's stability and functionality.

Installation:

Install the requests and win32com.client libraries using pip install requests win32com.client.
Save the script below as cis_hardening_auto.py.

Explanation:

The script defines the URL for the CIS benchmark repository and enumerates supported operating systems.
The get_os_type function identifies the current operating system type.
The download_cis_benchmark function downloads the appropriate CIS benchmark based on the OS type.
The apply_cis_hardening function invokes the appropriate hardening logic based on the OS type.
The main function orchestrates the process:
Determines the operating system type.
Downloads the CIS benchmark.
Applies CIS Level 2 hardening.
The script utilizes the requests library for downloading the benchmark and the win32com.client library for Windows hardening (requires separate script implementation for Linux).
Note:

This script currently supports Windows and requires further development for Linux hardening.
The script assumes the presence of a separate script named cis_hardening_windows.py for applying Windows hardening based on the CIS benchmark.
Ensure you have the required libraries and adjust the script to your specific needs.
Remember to carefully review the CIS benchmark and understand the impact of each setting before applying them in a production environment.
